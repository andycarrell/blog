# Mocking GraphQL in Cypress

> This guide references <a href="https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/migration-from-tools-v5/">graphql-tools v5</a>. For the latest version, <a href="/posts/mocking-graphql-in-cypress">follow the v6 guide</a>. You can find out more about migrating from v5 to v6 in the <a href="https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/migration-from-tools-v5/">official documentation</a>.

The frontend team at <a href="https://www.jasper.io/">Jasper</a> has had huge success using <a href="https://www.cypress.io/">Cypress</a> to test our web applications. It gives us confidence to deploy frequently, safety when we refactor, and the ability develop features before the API is implemented. The first two benefits are "out of the box" when testing with Cypress - by that I mean just by writing tests you increase confidence in deployments and refactors. To unlock developing features _independently of your backend_, I am a firm believer that you need to <a href="https://devopedia.org/mock-testing">mock the API</a>. Mocking also encourages writing more robust tests and covering a wider range of user experiences.

Whilst Cypress has built-in <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/network-requests.html#Stubbing">stub functionality for network requests</a>, our approach provides more flexibility and resilience for your mocks, and maintains the browser implementation of fetch. At the time of writing, <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/network-requests.html#Testing-Strategies">Cypress only supports intercepting `XMLHttpRequests`</a> - <a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/95">this Github issue</a> tracks more details and temporary workarounds.

Our approach is by no means the only way to mock GraphQL, but it has been highly successful in our team, and I am keen to share how we achieved it.

---

## Overview

First we'll create a schema which we can run queries against, but with mock resolvers. This step will largely follow the <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/mocking/">Apollo GraphQL guide</a> (via graphql-tools) to mocking.

Then we stub window fetch, using <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/stub.html">Cypress stub functionality</a>, specifically for GraphQL requests, and resolve against our mocked schema.

Inspired by <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-new-approach-to-mocking-graphql-data-1ef49de3d491/">this guide from Stripe</a>, we'll use their methods to unlock the ability to create custom mocks each time we need. The guide also heavily influenced mock providers we wrote and use for; development tools, unit testing, and <a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a> stories.

## Dependencies

The solution depends on these packages:

* <a href="https://graphql.org/graphql-js/"> graphql </a> - to resolve queries against your mocked schema
* <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/"> graphql-tools </a> - to make your schema 'executable' and add mock functions

If you don't already depend on these packages, you can add them as dev dependencies, using your project's package manager. In addition to these packages, there's some code to write and maintain within your project, which will be outlined in the article. Feel free to copy, update and change as you need.

## Copy your schema definition

Let's get started! The first thing to do is to get a copy of your schema. Fortunately for us, our development GraphQL server supports the "<a href="https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-playground/">playground</a>". We can access the entire schema at:

> `https://{API_SERVICE_DOMAIN}/playground`

Copy the definition into a file that can be imported as a plain string. We chose a plain JS file using a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals">template literal string</a>, because the JS definition looks as close to the copied output as possible.

```js
export default `
  type Account {
    id: ID!
    email: String!
    firstName: String!
    lastName: String!
  }
`;
```

We depend on a static definition of our schema for GraphQL mocks. This means every time the schema changes, we have to copy the new definition into our project. So far we haven't found this to be a huge cost, since a changing schema often means queries or mutations require a change too. There are methods of fetching the schema dynamically - which could be leveraged at run or build time - this is on our backlog, but maintaining a static copy hasn't had a high enough cost to make it a high priority.

## Make an executable schema and add mocks

Now we have a schema definition, we make an "executable" schema which allows us to resolve queries against it. This section of the guide is taken directly from the <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/mocking/">graphql-tools documentation</a>.

```js
import { makeExecutableSchema, addMockFunctionsToSchema } from 'graphql-tools';
import schemaString from './schemaDefinition';

// Make a GraphQL schema with no resolvers
const schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs: schemaString });
// Add mocks, modifies schema in place
addMockFunctionsToSchema({ schema });
```

We will define specific mock resolvers later, but for now the minimum requirement is to set defaults for any custom scalars you may have defined in your schema. For example, we have defined a scalar for DateTime. We expect it to be an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISOString</a> - so we define a 'resolver', which returns a mock value:

```js
// Add mocks, modifies schema in place
const mocks = {
  // Schema definition: 'scalar DateTime'
  // Also note the type - function that returns a primitive
  DateTime: () => new Date().toISOString(),
};

addMockFunctionsToSchema({ schema, mocks });
```

To explain what these initial steps achieve (<a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/mocking/#default-mock-example">from the graphql-tools docs</a>):

> This mocking logic simply looks at your schema and makes sure to return a string where your schema has a string, a number for a number, etc. So you can already get the right shape of result.

This is immediately a big win - any Query or Mutation we resolve against this schema will return with some result. We could drop in this executable schema and have a mock straightaway. The mock wouldn't be particularly reliable or consistent, so isn't a great fit for testing yet.

Conversely, the entire schema being mocked is extremely helpful for long term test maintenance - the suite has a built in resilience to (smaller) schema changes. Once the mocking utility is put together, and we've written tests that accurately define what they depend on, we have high confidence that tests only fail when the underlying code has changed.

## Stub window fetch

Disclaimer: we're using Apollo, which depends on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">fetch</a>. Other clients may use XHR, or you might be <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill">polyfilling</a> fetch. Depending on your exact use case, the following method might not work directly copied from here. Investigate exactly how your app interacts with the API - that's where you want to mock.

We'll stub the fetch function, using `cy.stub(...`, to replace the functionality by resolving the query against our mock schema. Then we'll create a <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands.html#Syntax">custom Cypress command</a>, because there's work in replacing the built in fetch function that would be tedious to do in every test. We want to have a different mock in each test, so that we can define the shape of the mock we need. This also allows us to only define the data we need, and encourages keeping tests independent. If you're not familiar with writing custom Cypress commands, check out the <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands.html#Syntax">official documentation</a>.
The end usage of the custom command looks like:

```js
describe("Test - Accounts", () => {
  it("should show an error when searching accounts", () => {
    cy.mockGraphQLApi({
      // Every instance of type Account will return:
      Account: () => ({
        email: "mocked@gmail.com",
        firstName: "Katherine",
        lastName: "French",
      }),
      // We can make queries fail by throwing an error
      Query: () => ({
        searchAccounts: () => {
          throw new Error("InternalServerError");
        },
      }),
    });

    cy.visit("/accounts");

    // Expect error state ...
  });
});
```

As an aside - I generally prefer repetition in tests because the consequence of over abstraction is much higher than application code. Even so, we've still written a number of custom Cypress commands extracting commands or sequences of commands where they are used frequently, relatively complicated, or where the commands don't concisely represent the intention of a test. We mock GraphQL in (almost) every test in this particular suite, so I think it's a really good candidate for a custom command.

Back to stubbing `window.fetch` - the Apollo documentation has <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/mocking/">an example resolving a query against the schema</a>:

```js
import { graphql } from "graphql";

// Make a GraphQL schema with no resolvers
// ...

graphql(schema, query).then((result) => {
  console.log('Got result', result);
});
```

We can use this function in place of where we would otherwise call our API:

```js
import { graphql } from "graphql";

// Make a GraphQL schema with no resolvers ...

const resolve = result => ({
  json: () => Promise.resolve(result),
  text: () => Promise.resolve(JSON.stringify(result)),
  ok: true,
});

Cypress.Commands.add("mockGraphQLApi", { prevSubject: false },
  () => {
    // Changes the window object before load
    // Call cy.mockGraphQLApi(...) before visiting the page
    cy.on("window:before:load", win => {
      function fetch(_, { body }) {
        const { query } = JSON.parse(body);
        return graphql(schema, query).then(resolve);
      }

      cy.stub(win, "fetch").callsFake(fetch);
    });
  }
);
```

This may work as is, but for us there were other parts of the app that required fetch to access the rest of the internet. The solution was to preserve the original implementation, and only call the stubbed version when the URL matches our API URL:

```js
import { graphql } from "graphql";

// Make a GraphQL schema with no resolvers ...
// const resolve = ...

function fetchMock(_, { body }) {
  const { query } = JSON.parse(body);
  return graphql(schema, query).then(resolve);
}

Cypress.Commands.add("mockGraphQLApi", { prevSubject: false },
  () => {
    // Your API's url - we use Cypress environment variables
    const queryUrl = `https://\${Cypress.env("API_SERVICE_DOMAIN")}/query`;

    cy.on("window:before:load", win => {
      // To debug here: const log = win.console.log
      const originalFetch = win.fetch;
      function fetch(url, ...rest) {
        if (url === queryUrl) {
          return fetchMock(url, ...rest);
        }
        return originalFetch(url, ...rest);
      }
      cy.stub(win, "fetch").callsFake(fetch);
    });
  }
);
```

## Changing mocks between tests

The mock we've made has a couple of limitations: any queries or mutations that pass variables will fail and our mock resolvers are "static", (defined once, hard-coded when we made the executable schema). This is less than ideal because we would have to use the same mock definition for every test.

Passing variables applies to almost every mutation, so we'll fairly quickly run into this issue. These queries will fail because _we haven't yet passed the variables to the `graphql` function to resolve against the schema_. The variables are passed as part of the "body" to fetch and need to be passed as the 5th argument to `graphql`.

```js
// const resolve = ...

const fetchMock = (_, { body }) => {
  const { query, variables } = JSON.parse(body);
  return graphql(schema, query, {}, {}, variables).then(resolve);
};

// Cypress.Commands.add("mockGraphQLApi", ...)
```

The next step is to merge default resolvers (which we've already defined) with specific resolvers, providing flexibility each time we mock the API.

It's worth noting at this point that the following functionality has been recognised as valuable, and potentially should be included in grapql-tools. <a href="https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-tools/pull/1084">At the time of writing there's an open pull request</a>. It's worth checking if this has been merged and the functionality added within the package.

We initially defined our mocks where we made the schema executable:

```js
// Completely static
const mocks = {
  // ...
};

addMockFunctionsToSchema({ schema, mocks });
```

Defining the mocks once is a big limitation - we really want to be able to change the mock per test, so that we can tailor the conditions we're testing under. This is initially fairly simple - generate the schema dynamically each time we call the custom Cypress command:

```js
import schemaString from './schemaDefinition';

function makeMockedSchema({ mocks }) {
  const schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs: schemaString });
  addMockFunctionsToSchema({ schema, mocks });
  return schema;
}

Cypress.Commands.add("mockGraphQLApi", { prevSubject: false },
  (mocks = {}) => {
    const schema = makeMockedSchema({ mocks });
    const queryUrl = `https://\${Cypress.env("API_SERVICE_DOMAIN")}/query`;

    function fetchMock(_, { body }) {
      const { query, variables } = JSON.parse(body);
      return graphql(
        schema, query, {}, {}, variables,
      ).then(resolve);
    }

    // cy.on("window:before:load", ...)
  }
);
```

This does allow us to define a different mock per test, but in every test we would have to also set any defaults that our schema required - for example setting a resolver for `DateTime`:

```js
cy.mockGraphQLApi({
  DateTime: () => new Date().toISOString(),
  // ... specific content we want to mock for this test
});
```

Whilst merging objects in JS using the spread operator (or even `Object.assign`) is fairly common, it won't be sufficient in this case. Most graphQL schemas will require deeply nesting objects, and the nested values of those objects may be functions (resolvers) too:

```js
cy.mockGraphQLApi({
  DateTime: () => new Date().toISOString(),
  Account: () => ({
    email: "mocked@gmail.com",
    address: () => ({
      city: "Auckland",
      country: "New Zealand",
    }),
  }),
});
```

Both these caveats mean simple object merging will not be sufficient. Fortunately the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-new-approach-to-mocking-graphql-data-1ef49de3d491/">Stripe guide</a> (which we followed right at the start of this guide) links to a function which can be used to merge default mocks with test specific definitions.

```js
function mergeResolvers(target, input) {
  const inputTypenames = Object.keys(input);

  return inputTypenames.reduce(
    (accum, key) => {
      const inputResolver = input[key];
      if (key in target) {
        const targetResolver = target[key];
        const resolvedInput = inputResolver();
        const resolvedTarget = targetResolver();

        if (
          !!resolvedTarget &&
          !!resolvedInput &&
          typeof resolvedTarget === "object" &&
          typeof resolvedInput === "object" &&
          !Array.isArray(resolvedTarget) &&
          !Array.isArray(resolvedInput)
        ) {
          const newValue = { ...resolvedTarget, ...resolvedInput };
          return { ...accum, [key]: () => newValue };
        }
      }
      return { ...accum, [key]: inputResolver };
    },
    { ...target }
  );
}
```

The original code for the merge resolvers function is <a href="https://gist.github.com/hellendag/2aa9ad1f9b771f38802760c269bb1b76">in a Github gist</a>, it's not long and can easily be copied into your project. We "maintain" a copy, although we haven't had to change it as yet.

We can then separate out our "default" mocks, (which we want to apply every time we mock the API), and mock definitions per test, then merge them in when we add mock functions to the schema:

```js
const defaultMocks = {
  DateTime: () => new Date(new Date()).toISOString(),
  Fraction: () => ({ numerator: 10, denominator: 45 }),
};

function makeMockedSchema({ mocks }) {
  const schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs: schemaString });
  const mergedMocks = mergeResolvers(defaultMocks, mocks);
  addMockFunctionsToSchema({ schema, mocks: mergedMocks });
  return schema;
}

// Cypress.Commands.add("mockGraphQLApi", ...)
```

## Mutations

So far we've exclusively looked at mock resolvers for entire types on the schema, which does get us most of the way there. In the case of a mutation - or a query that isn't a one to one mapping to a type - we need to mock resolvers for the Mutation / Query types respectively:

```js
cy.mockGraphQLApi({
  Account: () => ({
    email: "mocked@gmail.com",
    address: () => ({
      city: "Auckland",
      country: "New Zealand",
    }),
  }),
  Query: () => ({
    searchAccounts: () => [{
      email: "faked@gmail.com",
      address: () => ({
        city: "Wellington",
        country: "New Zealand",
      }),
    }],
  }),
  Mutation: () => ({
    updateAccount: () => ({
      address: () => ({
        city: "Sydney",
        country: "Australia",
      }),
    }),
  }),
});
```

Take note of the capitalisation - in our case types (Account, Query, Mutation), are <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/pascalcase">Pascal case</a> (upper camel case), and properties on types are <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/camelcase">camel case</a>. Although this matches our schema convention, forgetting to switch between the two can still be a bit of a trap.

We can also access the variables passed to a mutation or query from the second argument to our mock resolver. This is extremely useful for creating responsive mocks (which change based on what they're called with) and for asserting that the mock is called with the correct arguments.

```js
// For mutation definition:
// `mutation { updateAccount(email: "\${email}") { email } }`

cy.mockGraphQLApi({
  Mutation: () => ({
    updateAccount: (_, { email }) => {
      console.log(email);
      // ...
    },
  }),
});
```

## Piecing it all together

Alongside our schema definition, we extract `makeMockedSchema` into its own file. This enables us to reuse the mock in both Cypress and unit tests. For our unit tests we followed <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-new-approach-to-mocking-graphql-data-1ef49de3d491/">the rest of the Stripe guide</a>.

```js
import { makeExecutableSchema, addMockFunctionsToSchema } from 'graphql-tools';
// This is the schema string
import schemaDefinition from "./schemaDefinition";

function mergeResolvers(target, input) {
  const inputTypenames = Object.keys(input);

  return inputTypenames.reduce(
    (accum, key) => {
      const inputResolver = input[key];
      if (key in target) {
        const targetResolver = target[key];
        const resolvedInput = inputResolver();
        const resolvedTarget = targetResolver();

        if (
          !!resolvedTarget &&
          !!resolvedInput &&
          typeof resolvedTarget === "object" &&
          typeof resolvedInput === "object" &&
          !Array.isArray(resolvedTarget) &&
          !Array.isArray(resolvedInput)
        ) {
          const newValue = { ...resolvedTarget, ...resolvedInput };
          return { ...accum, [key]: () => newValue };
        }
      }
      return { ...accum, [key]: inputResolver };
    },
    { ...target }
  );
}

const defaultMocks = {
  DateTime: () => new Date(new Date()).toISOString(),
  Fraction: () => ({ numerator: 10, denominator: 45 }),
};

export default function makeMockedSchema({ mocks }) {
  const mergedMocks = mergeResolvers(defaultMocks, mocks);
  const schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs: schemaDefinition });
  addMockFunctionsToSchema({ schema, mocks: mergedMocks });

  return schema;
}
```

We then use `makeMockedSchem` in a custom Cypress command:

```js
import { graphql } from "graphql";
import makeMockedSchema from "./makeMockedSchema";

const resolve = result => ({
  json: () => Promise.resolve(result),
  text: () => Promise.resolve(JSON.stringify(result)),
  ok: true,
});

Cypress.Commands.add("mockGraphQLApi", { prevSubject: false },
  (mocks = {}) => {
    const queryUrl = `https://\${Cypress.env("API_SERVICE_DOMAIN")}/query`;
    const schema = makeMockedSchema({ mocks });
    const fetchMock = (_, { body }) => {
      const { query, variables } = JSON.parse(body);
      return graphql(schema, query, {}, {}, variables)
        .then(resolve);
    };

    cy.on("window:before:load", win => {
      const originalFetch = win.fetch;
      function fetch(url, ...rest) {
        if (url === queryUrl) {
          return fetchMock(url, ...rest);
        }
        return originalFetch(url, ...rest);
      }
      cy.stub(win, "fetch").callsFake(fetch);
    });
  },
);
```

And that's it! I've seen some other implementations and attempts at sharing this functionality as a testing tool/library, but I've found that owning this code gives us the flexibility to extend and change it as we need. The maintenance overhead compared to the value this adds has been an extremely good trade off for our team.

  ## Conclusion

Using this simple mocking utility has enabled us to write a large number of high fidelity tests that run completely independently of our backend servers. In turn, this encourages good test coverage of frontend features - not only has this been a development productivity boost, but has caught countless bugs before they even make their way to `main`.

In this guide, we've taken a look at how to mock a graphQL API in a deterministic and reusable way. At a high level, we followed these steps:

* Copy schema definition
* Make an executable schema, merge default and custom resolvers
* Stub fetch and resolve queries against the executable schema

My intent is to share our method with a comprehensive set of instructions, so other teams can realise the same benefits we have. Following this guide should get a mock GraphQL API up and going in your Cypress tests. At each step I've explained what we did and why, but I appreciate information might be lacking - if so <a href="https://twitter.com/andy__carrell">please reach out</a> and I can attempt to clarify. I'm open to feedback, and if you have a completely different way to do what we're doing, I'd love to hear that too.
